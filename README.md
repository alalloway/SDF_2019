# SDF_2019
Work created as part of the Summer Diversity Fellowship project: 'Developing and Visualizing New Types of U.S. Census Mapping Data' at the University of Minnesota's Minnesota Population Center.

This repository includes Python scripts for general processing tasks in GIS, written predominantly using ArcPy in Jupyter Notebook. 

This project deals with several main tasks centered around converting and processing Census 2000 geometries, including converting from coverages to shapefiles, merging data into higher level geometries (i.e. from county to state-level) and using tools such as dissolve or feature-to-line/poly in ArcPy.
